# Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, and has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain. While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure. As of 13 April 2020, more than 1.8 million cases have been reported in more than 200 countries and territories, resulting in more than 114090 deaths. More than 421497 people have recovered.
# Transmission
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined. The WHO and CDC say it is primarily spread during close contact and by small droplets produced when people cough, sneeze or talk; with close contact being within 1–3 m (3 ft. 3 in–9 ft. 10 in). A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughing can lead to droplets traveling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet). A second study, produced during the 2020 pandemic, found that advice on the distance droplets could travel might be based on old 1930s research which ignored the protective effect and speed of the warm moist outbreath surrounding the droplets; it advised that droplets can travel around 7–8 meters.


# Objective:
The objective of this work is to analyze the confirmed, death, active, recovered cases and mortality rate (per 100) of the different geographical locations of the world.

# Continent wise Analysis:
As we know this has been a pandemic for the world we can easily conclude that the COVID-19 has not been limited to a certain continent. 

* Tabular Data:

</p>
(Continent wise tabular data)

Europe has the highest number of cases across the globe. 
This shows the disease causes in all cases except the mortality rate is more in North America whereas South America's very less significant number is compared to North America even if the geographical location is very near to North America. But The mortality rate in SA is 4.14 percent which is lgreater than NA.
Asia continent which is the origin of COVID-19 has third-highest numbers in all cases except mortality rate.
Africa continent has fewer cases compared to other continents but the mortality rate is 5.44% which shows not a good sign that comes in the second number. 
Australia which is far away from other continents has less affected cases compared to other continents

# Confirmed cases in different continents:

# Death cases in different Continents:

</p>
 
# Mortality Rate:
We can see that the mortality rate of different continents varies. The high mortality is found in Europe whereas the low mortality rate is in Australia. It seems to be the mortality rate of the whole world is increasing day by day.

# Country Wise Analysis:
The total number of affected countries across the globe is more than 206 till Dt. 13.04.2020. 
The USA has the most Confirmed cases whereas Italy has the highest number of deaths. China has the biggest number of recovered patients.
Italy which is a country of European continent though it has the second number of active cases the mortality rate is high among all highly affected countries.

# Spread Analysis of COVID-19:
The following graph indicates the spread of COVID-19 from 22nd Jan increased linearly till the last of Jan then the curve remains flattened around 25th of Feb. After that, the affected no of countries increased linearly to reach around 160 countries. Then it seems to be slow down.

# India Case Study:
A total of 31 Indian states and union territories has been affected by COVID-19. The mortality rate is 3.59% whereas in Asia the number is 3.68%. It might increase with the increase in the number of cases.

# The affected States of Confirmed cases in India: 
In India mortality rate also varies in different geographical locations. The highest mortality rate of state Jharkhand  is 10% though the number of cases is very less. If we consider Maharastra which has the highest number of cases. The mortality rate is 5%. Odisha holds the 12th position in terms of mortality rate.

# China Case Study:
The origin-country of COVID-19 has managed to flatten its confirm cases curve as well as death cases. Italy has a 3 times higher mortality rate in China.

# Prediction: 

# Neural Network:

	A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network (ANN) with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
	
	The DNN finds the correct mathematical manipulation to turn the input into the output, whether it be a linear relationship or a non-linear relationship.
	
	The network moves through the layers calculating the probability of each output. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed.
	
	The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN has many layers, hence the name "deep" networks.
	
	In this work, DNN is used to predict the increasing number of cases and confirmed deaths over time.

# Support Vector Machine:

SVM algorithm is used for supervised machine learning that is both for data classification and regression analysis. It classifies efficiently both linear and nonlinearly separable data by creating a hyperplane for data in the original space. The dot product of hyperplane with a vector is constant in that space. The hyperplane can be represented as 
w ⃗.x ⃗-b=0                              
Where, w is considered as a normalized vector to the hyperplane, x set of points and b/(||w||) can be calculated by the equation of distance from a point to a plane. If the data points are linearly separable then by taking two parallel hyperplanes having distance between them is as much as possible. The bounded region is called the margin. It indicates the data points belong to either class of the data.

# Remark:
	The mortality rate of COVID-19 varies in different geographical locations.
	
	If we compare three countries India, China, and the USA. China has the highest mortality rate of 4.03 which comes under continent Asia. Asia comes in 5th position in terms of mortality rate i.e. 3.69.
	
	The most affected country the USA has a mortality rate of 3.97 which is a country in North America. North America has a mortality rate of 3.05 which holds the 4th position.
	
	India has the less number of mortality rate compared to china and USA i.e 3.59
	
	If the cases grow in this way the world will face new confirmed cases next week is near about 2.5 million whereas the death cases will grow to 2.5 lacks. And the mortality rate will become 10 per 100 people.
